# SQL-project

In this project I explored the publicly available chinook database using SQLite. Queries and outputs can be found in the 'SQL Commands' file.

This exploration provides insights into sales patterns, employee information, track categorization, and customer distribution.

The database itself is stored in 'chinook.db' in this repository. Additionally, 'phpu5nSW1.png' contains a database schema. Tables, columns and relationships between tables are shown here.
